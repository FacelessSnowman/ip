# AI Tools Used in My Project

## ChatGPT

I used ChatGPT for fixing some of my Javadoc comments. It saved time and worked well, but I still had to manually fix some of the formatting errors.

## Claude.ai

I used Claude.ai to debug an error where the application crashes when the first command entered upon running is invalid.
